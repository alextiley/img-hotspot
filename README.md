img-hotspot
===========

This tool allows a user to plot hotspots to any image and apply some meta data to each hotspot tag. The tool will then generate a HTML snippet which can be embedded into your blog or website.

To get started why not download this code and have a play? The code isn't completed so there are bugs =)

Notes: clicking generate will currently push some HTML to the console, but doesn't do much more than that. Need to finish this...
